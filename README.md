# solarplanets

Implements a self-contained mean-rate (first-order) model of planetary elements, including top-level transform sequence for computing position and velocity state (in a heliocentric ecliptic frame).

Based on Curtis's "Orbital Mechanics for Engineering Students"--specifically, 8.10 "Planetary Ephemeris".

Includes some degree of self-contained documentation, testing, and coverage behaviors in `package.json` scripts.
